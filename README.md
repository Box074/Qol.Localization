# Qol.Localization

A mod that translates the Qol menu

## How to use

If your language is Chinese, you can use it directly. Of course, you can also add missing translations.

Create a new file `Qol.Localization.{LangName}.lang` in the mod directory, such as `Qol.Localization.zh.lang`

The value of `{LangName}` is one of the following (i.e. lowercase of the Name of the SupportedLanguages enumeration)

- fr
- de
- zh
- es
- ko
- ja
- it
- pt
- ru

Please use `template.lang` as template, modify it like `Res/zh.txt`
